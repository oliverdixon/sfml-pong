# sfml-pong

This repository contains a basic *Pong* implementation using the
C++ [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
(SFML).

This is [my](http://github.com/oliverdixon) first non-trivial C++
project, and was primarily used as a learning aid.

#### External Resources

The game requires the “28 Days Later” true-type font file, or some
suitable substitute, which cannot be distributed with this source for
licencing reasons. For the game to function correctly, users are
recommended to download
[the font archive](https://www.1001freefonts.com/28-days-later.font),
and move the TTF to the project root under the name `font.ttf`.
